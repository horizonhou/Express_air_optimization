# Express_air_optimization
# Summary
This report serves as the final project report for the ORIE5380 Optimization course over the time period of Fall 2022.
In this report, we formulate a miÙè∞§ed integer linear program to solve for the optimal cargo shipping schedule for Express Air. We reach an optimal cost of 17925 given 1200 aircraft and a set of constraints. By doing sensitivity analysis, we find that we can decrease the cost by increasing the fleet size and amount of incoming cargo in some scenarios. We can decrease the cost by 20 by adding one aircraft to the fleet. The rate of decrease is maintained until the fleet size increases to 1282. To decrease the cost by adding the amount of cargo needed to be shipped, the most beneficial way is to increase the cargo needed to be shipped from B to A. One unit of increase of cargo gives us a 7 decrease in total cost. Similarly, we can decrease the number of cargo needed to be shipped from A to B on Friday to decrease the total cost by 27/unit.
